## The Application of Mathematics in Analysing Algorithmic Efficiency by Isaac Eason

All of the programs from my Waynflete can be found on this GitHub page in the required folders. All of the programs are written in Python.

Each algorithm has a unique folder with two different programs:
- **user.py**  
  The user program allows for an input and will output the algorithm's result.
- **analysis.py**  
  The analysis program will output the mean and standard deviation of the run-time for the set inputs and number of trials.
