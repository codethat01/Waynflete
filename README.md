# Waynflete Algorithm Implementations
## The Application of Mathematics in Analysing Algorithmic Efficiency
### by Isaac Eason

In each section's folder, all the programs are listed for each algorithm. There are the following folders available:
- Introduction
  - InsertionSort
  - MergeSort
- Problem1
  - InitalAlgorithm
  - OptimisedAlgorithm
- Problem2
  - FirstAlgorithm
  - SecondAlgorithm
  - ThirdAlgorithm

Each algorithm has a unique folder with two different programs:
- **user.py**  
  The user program allows for an input and will output the algorithm's result.
- **analysis.py**  
  The analysis program will output the mean and standard deviation of the run-time for the set inputs and number of trials.
