# Waynflete Algorithm Implementations
## The Application of Mathematics in Analysing Algorithmic Efficiency
### by Isaac Eason

Each algorithm from the paper has two different programs:
- **user.py**  
  This program takes an input from the user, and outputs the algorithm's result.
- **analysis.py**  
  The analysis program outputs the mean and standard deviation run-time for the algorithm. The input and number of trials can be changed accordingly.
